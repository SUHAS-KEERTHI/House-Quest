REAL-TIME EMAIL NOTIFICATIONS:-

Please note that this application will provide real-time email notifications to users in certain situations.
To ensure that you receive these notifications, when you sign up as a user, use a valid, existing email address.

For example, house hunters will receive email notifications when a realtor replies to an inquiry. To enable such notifications, please use a valid, existing email address.



FACEBOOK SIGNUP:-

We have provided users the option of signing up for the application using their Facebook account. Please note that if you sign up through Facebook, all your profile details are obtained directly from Facebook and therefore, you will not be able to edit your details.

Also, a Facebook signed up user can ONLY BE A HOUSEHUNTER. This is because we believe that a realtor must provide more information that aligns with pre-stored data regarding things like Real Estate companies, etc. and have therefore restricted Facebook users to being ONLY HOUSEHUNTERS.


CHANGING YOUR ROLE:-

One of the requirements was to allow a particular user to sign up as both as a Realtor and a Househunter. To do this in our application, a user is required to edit his/her role by using the edit profile option on his/her homepage.


FIELDS THAT MUST BE LEFT BLANK:-

Often, to preserve the integrity of SQL queries running in the backend, we have added fields that may require information that is not relevant to a particular user type. For example, while singing up as a House Hunter, you might encounter a field that asks you for your real estate company, which obviously does not apply to you.

While encountering such fields, we have clearly displayed messages that tell you to ignore filling certain fields in case of particular roles. In the above example, near the field to fill the Real Estate Company, we have specified that if you are a house hunter, you shouldn't fill the field. Please follow such directions whenever you find them.


LAYOUT DESCRIPTION:-

After signing in, the user's homepage can have up to 4 sections - USERS, HOUSES, REAL ESTATE COMPANIES, and INQUIRIES.

The sections that will be displayed depend upon the user's role.

1. An admin will have access to all the sections, and can perform allowed operations in the same.

2. A house hunter will have access to the HOUSES section, where he/she can view and search listed houses, and the INQUIRIES section, where he/she can create and view inquiries.

3. A realtor will have access to the HOUSES section, where he/she can list houses, the INQUIRIES section, where he/she can reply to inquries, and the REAL ESTATE COMPANY section, where he/she can view companies and edit their company's details.
